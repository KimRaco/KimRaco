### Hi, I'm Kim 👋

<h1> Web Developer Jr. </h1>

<p>
  I am a creative and kind person capable of adapting to any situation. 🔭 I am currently seeking a job opportunity where I can demonstrate my commitment and ability to work, while also allowing for my intellectual growth and the development of my technical knowledge. I am currently learning Java and have recently completed an intensive bootcamp where I gained practical experience with new technologies and collaborated with other developers✨.
